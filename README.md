# What are the main factors influencing the fluctuations in sales and profit?

# What are the main factors influencing this distribution?

● Insight

The post-pandemic economic recovery has led to changes in consumer purchasing power, particularly in areas that were more severely affected. The shift in customer behavior towards digital services and e-commerce has also altered transaction distribution patterns. Additionally, supply chain disruptions and changes in health regulations have impacted product distribution.

● Actionable Insight

1. Optimization of Omnichannel: Strengthen the synergy between physical stores and digital platforms to ensure more equitable service across all regions.

2. Regionalization Strategy: Reassess distribution and stock strategies for areas experiencing a decline in transactions to improve product availability.

3. Adaptation to Post-Pandemic Trends: Focus on preventive health products, telemedicine, and loyalty programs to enhance customer retention.

# What factors cause fluctuations?

● Insight

Fluctuations are influenced by seasonal factors and changes in shopping behavior post-COVID-19. The beginning of the year recorded a surge in sales due to the need for stock after the holidays and increased health awareness, while February experienced a decline due to the low season and national holidays. Recovery occurred in March due to preparations for Ramadan and the stable demand for health products, supported by holiday moments, seasonal promotions, and community adaptations returning to normal activities while still maintaining health precautions.

● Actionable Insight

1. Optimize Seasonal Promotions: Focus promotions at the beginning of the year, during Ramadan, and at the end of the year to drive sales during high demand periods.

2. Anticipate Low Season: Implement discounts or special bundling in February to maintain stable transactions.

3. Strengthen Health Product Availability: Ensure the availability of mental health and immunity products, as the demand remains high post-COVID-19.

# What factors influence product performance?

● Insight

The dominance of mental health products is influenced by the post-COVID-19 impact, with an increase in awareness of emotional well-being, immunity, and the need for recovery and pain management.

● Actionable Insight

1. Focus on Promoting Key Products: Enhance promotions for top-selling products in the psycholeptics category, such as KF664, to maintain sales contributions.

2. Encourage Cross-Selling: Market complementary products like vitamins and supplements to increase transaction value per customer.

3. Evaluate Other Categories: Review the potential for developing categories with low contributions for new growth opportunities.

# What factors influence customer loyalty?

● Insight

Customer loyalty is driven by the availability of products at branches, encouraging repeat orders, supported by branch services with high ratings that create positive experiences for customers, as well as attractive discount programs that can increase the frequency of repeat transactions.

● Actionable Insight

1. Prioritize VIP & Loyal Customers: Provide exclusive programs and personalization to maintain retention.

2. Optimize Branch Potential: Enhance services at customers' favorite branches.

3. Encourage Repeat Transactions: Create special bundling promotions for active customers.

# What factors influence the distribution and performance of branches?

● Insight

The performance of branches and the distribution of customers are influenced by regional density, market needs, and the quality of service at each branch. Branches in strategic areas with high demand and good service tend to record significant sales and loyal customers.

● Actionable Insight

1. Strengthen Branch Potential: Focus on developing branches with high performance to maintain loyalty and increase sales.

2. Expand Coverage: Optimize areas with high transaction potential, especially in Java Island.

3. Standardize Services: Implement the best service standards to ensure customer satisfaction across all branches.
